## Accomplishments:

I am proud to build a website where pet lovers can easily adopt animals that need a home. They can not only provide medical assistance to them but can also allow their fellow comrades in the community to adopt them.

## What's next for PetMe üì≤

In future, i plan to scale this application to reach as many people as possible and facilitate adoption and donation of animals.

Furthermore, i plan to connect with the nearest government organization that provides medical assistance to stray animals.
